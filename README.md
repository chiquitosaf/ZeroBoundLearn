This mobile application serves as a peer tutor search platform, with a focus on school students, both as tutors and as students. The reason for developing this app came about due to an awareness of the disparity in the quality of education in Indonesia, especially outside of major cities. With this app, we aim to give students who have not had access to quality education the opportunity to find peer tutors from their more advantaged peers, as well as learn together through video conferencing at no cost. The booking process is done by the student filling in the form of the subject, the material they want to learn, and specifying the deadline of the session. The app will then find a tutor, allow the student and tutor to communicate, time the learning session before the deadline, and carry out the learning via video conference. After the session ends, the student can provide an assessment for the tutor.
